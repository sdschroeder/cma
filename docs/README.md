**Planning and rationale (applied):**
- [PROJECT-ORGANIZATION-RECOMMENDATION.md](PROJECT-ORGANIZATION-RECOMMENDATION.md) — Recommended folder structure and rationale; **applied** (current layout is as recommended). Kept for rationale and future changes.
- [CONTENT-OVERLAP-AND-CONSOLIDATION.md](CONTENT-OVERLAP-AND-CONSOLIDATION.md) — Content overlap analysis and consolidation rules; **applied** (implementation plan slimmed, StoryCycle Genie consolidated, cross-references added). Kept for "what not to combine" and future edits.
